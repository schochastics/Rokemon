# Rokemon <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="125px"/>

An R package to create Pokemon inspired ggplots. It also comes with dataset of 801 Pokemon
with 41 different features (Gotta analyze'em all!). 

## Overview

For more details and examples see next sections.

Data

* `pokemon`: Data frame containing attributes and stats of 801 Pokemon.

Functions

* `gghealth()`: HP bar inspired Bar charts.
* `poke_pie()`: create pie charts from color distribution of Pokemon sprites.

Themes

* `theme_rocket()`: Team Rocket theme
* `theme_gameboy()` and `theme_gba()`: classic Gameboy and Gameboy Advanced themes
* `theme_status()`: inspired by Pokemon status bar
* `theme_mystic()`, `theme_valor()`, `theme_instinct()`: Pokemon Go teams theme; work well with
`annotate_pogo()`
* `scale_color_poketype()` and `scale_fill_poketype()`: Provides colors, if Pokemon types are mapped to color/fill 

Pokemon Palettes

* `poke_pal()`: color palettes created from Pokemon sprites
* `display_poke_pal()`: view a Pokemon color palette

## Install

The developer version can be obtained from github.
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("schochastics/Rokemon")
```

```{r load-libs,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Rokemon)
library(tidyverse)

data(pokemon)
```

## Themes

The package includes several themes for ggplot. 

### Theme Rocket

*(See what I did there...)*

```{r theme-rocket}
ggplot(pokemon,aes(attack,defense))+
  geom_point(col = "grey")+
  theme_rocket()+
  labs(x = "Jessy",y = "James",
       title = "Theme Rocket",
       subtitle = "blast off at the speed of light!",
       caption = "meowth that's right")

```

### Gamyboy theme

If you want to get nostalgic.

```{r theme-gameboy}
ggplot(pokemon,aes(attack,defense))+
  geom_point(shape = 15,col = "#006400",size=2)+
  theme_gameboy()+
  labs(title = "Classic Gameboy Theme")

```


```{r theme-gba}
ggplot(pokemon,aes(attack,defense))+
  geom_point(shape = 15,col = "#27408B",size=2)+
  theme_gba()+
  labs(title = "Gameboy Advanced Theme")
```


### Status theme and HP bar chart

A theme inspired by HP bar in older Pokemon games. The theme is used in `gghealth`,
a function that plots bar charts in HP bar style.

```{r gghealth}
pokemon[1:10,] %>% 
  gghealth("name","base_total",init.size = 5)+
  labs(x="",y="Stats Total")

```

### Pokemon Go

Annotate your plots with the logo of your favorite Pokémon Go team.

```{r pogo-teams,fig.height=4,fig.width=10}

p1 <- pokemon %>%
  dplyr::filter(type1=="water") %>%
  ggplot(aes(defense,attack))+geom_point()+annotate_pogo(team = "mystic")+theme_mystic()+
  labs(title="Team Mystic",subtitle="Water Pokemon")

p2 <- pokemon %>%
  dplyr::filter(type1=="fire") %>%
  ggplot(aes(defense,attack))+geom_point()+annotate_pogo(team = "valor")+theme_valor()+
  labs(title="Team Valor",subtitle="Fire Pokemon")

p3 <- pokemon %>%
  dplyr::filter(type1=="electric") %>%
  ggplot(aes(defense,attack))+geom_point()+annotate_pogo(team = "instinct")+theme_instinct()+
  labs(title="Team Instinct",subtitle="Electric Pokemon")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs=list(p1,p2,p3),ncol=3)

```

## Poke Pie

Create pie charts of the color distribution of Pokemon sprites. Download all sprites, for
example from [here](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites).

```{r poke-pie,eval=FALSE}
#basic usage
poke_pie(path_to_sprites,pokemon_name)
```

![](figures/poke-pies.png)

The function is a reimplementation of [this](https://gist.github.com/need12648430/4d681c9d1b18745ce159)
code, which was posted on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2ey1pw/last_night_i_wrote_a_processing_script_that/ck45c21/) a while ago.

## Color Palettes

The package also includes color palettes, which were automatically generated from
all 801 pokemon sprites. 
```{r poke-pals,eval=FALSE}
poke_pal(name,n)
display_poke_pal(name)
```
![](figures/palettes.png)

Additionally there is also a palette Pokemon Types, used by `scale_color_poketype()` and
`scale_fill_poketype()`.
![](figures/rocket-type-pal.png)

I did not check all Pokemon palettes, so there may well be
some meaningless ones. A better alternative would be to use the dedicated package `palettetown`.
See the github [repo](https://github.comt/imcdlucas/palettetown) for help. 
```{R palettes, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('palettetown')
```

## Fonts

The package uses an old school gameboy font for some of its themes, which
can be download [here](https://github.com/Superpencil/pokemon-font/releases/tag/v1.8.1).

In order to use the font in R you need the `extrafont` package.
```{R install-fonts, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("extrafont")
extrafont::font_import() #only run ones
extrafont::loadfonts()
```

Alternatively, you can use the function `import_pokefont()`.
```{r import-fonts,eval=FALSE}
import_pokefont()
```

## Example use of data

Using `theme_rocket()` to create an effectiveness table of Pokemon types.
```{r effectiveness,fig.width=9,fig.height=6}
pokemon %>%
  distinct(type1,.keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  select(defender = type1,against_bug:against_water) %>%
  gather(attacker,effect,against_bug:against_water) %>%
  mutate(attacker = str_replace_all(attacker,"against_",""))  %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=attacker,x=defender,fill=factor(effect)))+
  geom_tile()+
  geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(effect!=1,effect,"")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#8B1A1A", "#CD2626", "#EE2C2C", "#FFFFFF", "#00CD00", "#008B00"))+
  theme_rocket(legend.position="none")+
  labs(title="Effectiveness Table")

```

Using Pokemon type colors

```{r poketype-colors}
ggplot(pokemon,aes(defense,attack))+
  geom_point(aes(col=type1))+
  scale_color_poketype()+
  theme_bw()
```
